Description: Prospector
        =====
        Conduct principled inference of stellar population properties from photometric
        and/or spectroscopic data.  Prospector allows you to:
        
        * Combine photometric and spectroscopic data rigorously using a flexible
          spectroscopic calibration model.
        
        * Infer high-dimensional stellar population properties using parameteric SFHs
          (with ensemble MCMC sampling)
        
        * Use spectra and/or photometry to constrain the linear combination of stellar population
          components that are present in a galaxy (e.g. non-parametric SFHs).
        
        * Fit individual stellar spectra using large (in both n and d) interpolated
          grids, or polynomial spectral interpolators (coming soon).
        
        * Forward model many aspects of spectroscopic data analysis and
          calibration, including spectrophotometric calibration, sky emission (coming soon),
          and wavelength solution (coming soon), thus properly incorporating uncertainties
          in these components in the final  parameter uncertainties.
        
        Installation
        ------
        ```
        cd <install_dir>
        git clone https://github.com/bd-j/prospector
        cd prospector
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Then in Python
        ```python
        import prospect
        ```
        
        Prospector is pure python.
        See [installation](doc/installation.rst) for requirements.
        Other files in the [doc/](doc/) directory explain the usage of the code.
        
        See also the [tutorial](demo/tutorial.rst), the [interactive demo](demo/InteractiveDemo.ipynb),
        or the [deconstructed demo](demo/DeconstructedDemo.ipynb) for fitting photometric data with composite stellar populations.
